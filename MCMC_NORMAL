metropolis1 = function(n = 1000, eps= 0.5){ # eps = epsilon
  ## SO WE FEED NUMBER OF ITERATIONS AND SIZE OF THE STEPS
  
  vec = vector("numeric", n) # Start a numeric vector of length n
 
  x = 0 
  vec[1] = x # The first entry of the vector is 0.
  
  for (i in 2:n) {# The others entries in the vector "vec" (after the first) are....
    
    innovation = runif(1,-eps,eps) # One random uniform from -eps to eps
    # The values of x are updated by adding an "innovation" sampled from a symmetrical distr.
    
    candidate_value = x + innovation # whatever the x was on prior round + random unif from -0.5 to 0.5
    # The proposed new value will be x + runif
    ## THE CANDIDATE (PROPOSED VALUE) COMES FROM A UNIFORM - the transition kernel
    
    acceptance_ratio = min(1, dnorm(candidate_value)/dnorm(x)) 
    # dnorm(0) [1] 0.3989423 but we keep on updating the x, so it changes.
    # We are taking the ratio of the height on the bell curve of the 
    # candidate value to the height on the curve of the prior x.
    # Since we only take values up to 1 ("min(1,...)") this is actually
    # a probability!!! Because the higher the acceptance_ratio
    # the more chances of passing the next test ("if (u < acceptance_ratio)")
    
    # Acceptance probability = a(xnew|xold) = min(1, A)
    # with A = p(xnew) q(xold|xnew) / [p(old) q(xnew|xold)]
    # IFF the ratio is less than 1 (candidate shorter than prior x on bell) 
    # we take the RATIO.
    
    ##Therefore, THE TESTING OF THE CANDIDATE IS AGAINST A NORMAL DISTR.
    
    u = runif (1) # One draw from 0 to 1
    
    if (u < acceptance_ratio) 
      
    # Here we take a second random uniform, this time from 0 to 1.
    # and only if the ratio is larger than it will we replace
    # the prior x with the candidate value.
      
      x = candidate_value # Attention: here the x gets replaced, provided...
    
    vec[i] = x # And entered into the corresponding position in vec
